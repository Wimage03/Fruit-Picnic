## Level Design

### Level 1
The probability mechanics were implemented exactly as specified.

### Level 2
A different approach was used:
- After a match is made, we reference the fruit directly below the matched area.
- We analyze the neighboring fruits (8, 5, or 3, depending on the position) to calculate the probability as specified.
- This calculated probability applies to the **first generated fruit**. 
- All subsequent fruits generated will have a **60% chance of matching the color** of the fruit generated immediately before them.

## Scoring System

The scoring system was **fine-tuned through playtesting** by me and a friend:
- We played each level multiple times and calculated the average score.
- **Scoring thresholds**:
  - Below the average score: **1 star**
  - At the average score: **2 stars**
  - Above the average score: **3 stars**
- Each fruit match grants **100 points**:
  - A match of five fruits yields **500 points**.
  - A match of six fruits yields **600 points**.
